    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup caramel sauce, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup (168g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon flake salt, for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <h3>Make the caramel sauce:</h3><p>I use this caramel recipe. It comes together in about 10 minutes. Once finished, let cool to room temperature and then place in the fridge to fully chill before making the brownie batter.</p></li>
        <li> <h3>Prepare the pan:</h3><p>Preheat the oven to 325°F degrees. Coat an 8 x 8 square metal baking pan with cooking spray.</p><p>Make a parchment sling by lining the pan with parchment paper and leaving an inch overhang on either side. This will make it easier to remove the brownies from the pan. Spray parchment and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Prep dry ingredients:</h3><p>In a small bowl whisk flour and cocoa to break up any cocoa clumps and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Melt butter and chocolate:</h3><p>In a large pot (4 quart), set over medium low heat, add the butter and chocolate. Stir until both are melted and fully combined. Remove from heat.</p></li>



    </ol>
